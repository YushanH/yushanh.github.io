  abstract = {We present a novel paradigm for modeling certain types of dynamic simulation in real-time with the aid of neural networks. In order to significantly reduce the requirements on data (especially time-dependent data), as well as decrease generalization error, our approach utilizes a data-driven neural network only to capture quasistatic information (instead of dynamic or time-dependent information). Subsequently, we augment our quasistatic neural network (QNN) inference with a (real-time) dynamic simulation layer. Our key insight is that the dynamic modes lost when using a QNN approximation can be captured with a quite simple (and decoupled) zero-restlength spring model, which can be integrated analytically (as opposed to numerically) and thus has no time-step stability restrictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spring constitutive parameters can be robustly learned from a surprisingly small amount of dynamic simulation data. Although we illustrate the efficacy of our approach by considering soft-tissue dynamics on animated human bodies, the paradigm is extensible to many different simulation frameworks.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
