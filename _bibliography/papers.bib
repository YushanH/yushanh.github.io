  abstract = {The Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) approach of Macklin et al. [2016] addresses the issues with iteration-dependent behavior in the original Position Based Dynamics [2007] (PBD) which itself is a powerful method for the real-time simulation of elastic objects. However, it is limited in its application to hyperelastic solids. It can only treat models with a strain energy density that is quadratic in some notion of constraint. Furthermore, we show that even when applicable the formulation does not always lead to convergent behaviors with hyperelasticity. We isolate the root cause in the approximate linearization of the nonlinear backward Euler systems utilized by XPBD. We provide two fixes to these terms that allow for convergent behavior. The first (B-PXPBD) is a small modification to an existing XPBD code, but can only be used with models addressable by the original XPBD. The second (FP-PXPBD) is a more general formulation that extends XPBD (and our residual correction) to arbitrary hyperelasticity. We show that our modifications allow for convergent behavior that rivals accurate techniques like Newtonâ€™s method when the computational budget is large without sacrificing the stable and robust behavior exhibited by the original PBD and XPBD when the computational budget is limited.},

  abstract = {Abstract The creation of a volumetric mesh representing the interior of an input polygonal mesh is a common requirement in graphics and computational mechanics applications. Most mesh creation techniques assume that the input surface is not self-intersecting. However, due to numerical and/or user error, input surfaces are commonly self-intersecting to some degree. The removal of self-intersection is a burdensome task that complicates workflow and generally slows down the process of creating simulation-ready digital assets. We present a method for the creation of a volumetric embedding hexahedron mesh from a self-intersecting input triangle mesh. Our method is designed for efficiency by minimizing use of computationally expensive exact/adaptive precision arithmetic. Although our approach allows for nearly no limit on the degree of self-intersection in the input surface, our focus is on efficiency in the most common case: many minimal self-intersections. The embedding hexahedron mesh is created from a uniform background grid and consists of hexahedron elements that are geometrical copies of grid cells. Multiple copies of a single grid cell are used to resolve regions of self-intersection/overlap. Lastly, we develop a novel topology-aware embedding mesh coarsening technique to allow for user-specified mesh resolution as well as a topology-aware tetrahedralization of the hexahedron mesh.},

  abstract = {We present a momentum conserving hybrid particle/grid iteration for resolving volumetric elastic collision. Our hybrid method uses implicit time stepping with a Lagrangian finite element discretization of the volumetric elastic material together with impulse-based collision-correcting momentum updates designed to exactly conserve linear and angular momentum. We use a two-step process for collisions: first we use a novel grid-based approach that leverages the favorable collision resolution properties of Particle-In-Cell (PIC) techniques, then we finalize with a classical collision impulse strategy utilizing continuous collision detection. Our PIC approach uses Affine-Particle-In-Cell momentum transfers as collision preventing impulses together with novel perfectly momentum conserving boundary resampling and downsampling operators that prevent artifacts in portions of the boundary where the grid resolution is of disparate resolution. We combine this with a momentum conserving augury iteration to remove numerical cohesion and model sliding friction. Our collision strategy has the same continuous collision detection as traditional approaches, however our hybrid particle/grid iteration drastically reduces the number of iterations required. Lastly, we develop a novel symmetric positive semi-definite Rayleigh damping model that increases the convexity of the nonlinear systems associated with implicit time stepping. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach in a number of collision intensive examples.},

  abstract = {We present a novel paradigm for modeling certain types of dynamic simulation in real-time with the aid of neural networks. In order to significantly reduce the requirements on data (especially time-dependent data), as well as decrease generalization error, our approach utilizes a data-driven neural network only to capture quasistatic information (instead of dynamic or time-dependent information). Subsequently, we augment our quasistatic neural network (QNN) inference with a (real-time) dynamic simulation layer. Our key insight is that the dynamic modes lost when using a QNN approximation can be captured with a quite simple (and decoupled) zero-restlength spring model, which can be integrated analytically (as opposed to numerically) and thus has no time-step stability restrictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spring constitutive parameters can be robustly learned from a surprisingly small amount of dynamic simulation data. Although we illustrate the efficacy of our approach by considering soft-tissue dynamics on animated human bodies, the paradigm is extensible to many different simulation frameworks.},
