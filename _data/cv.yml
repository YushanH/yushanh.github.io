      year: 06/2021 - Current
      description:
        - Devised a novel neural network pipeline for real-time (1000X faster than simulation) character rig corrections for improving metaverse realism on human muscle contractions/interactions, volume preservation, and collisions.
        - Implemented multi-layer FEM human soft tissue simulation and biomechanics-based muscle activation solvers. 
        - Proposed a novel muscle contraction constitutive model and decoupled passive/active networks for skin deformations.
        - Developed an analytic real-time (90 fps) spring model for adding secondary physics dynamics, e.g., inertia.
        - Implemented game engine physics solvers (to be released under Chaos Flesh framework, Unreal Engine 5.5).
