#### about

I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Applied Math at UCLA. My advisor is Prof.**[Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/)**. My primary research focus lies at the intersection of physics-based simulation and machine learning, with a special emphasis on the simulation of human soft tissues. My recent works include numerically solving nonlinear PDEs from elasticity, neural networks for real-time correctives on animated characters and muscle inverse dynamics as neural network inputs.

Additionally, I'm a research intern at Epic Games where I am actively involved in the development of Chaos Flesh within the Unreal Engine framework.
