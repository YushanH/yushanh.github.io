#### about

I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Applied Math at UCLA. My advisor is Prof.**[Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/)**. My primary research focus lies at the intersection of physics-based simulation and machine learning, with a special emphasis on the simulation of human soft tissues. My recent works include numerically solving nonlinear partial differential equations, computing biomechanically correct muscle inverse dynamics and training neural networks for real-time correctives on character rigs.

Additionally, I'm a research intern at Epic Games where I am actively involved in the development of Chaos Flesh within the Unreal Engine framework.
