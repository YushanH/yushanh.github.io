#### about

I'm currently a Physics Engineer at Epic Games developing the **[Chaos Flesh](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/BEby/unreal-engine-chaos-flesh)** project in Unreal Engine that supports physically and biomechanically correct human soft tissue simulations. I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics at UCLA, under the supervision of **[Prof. Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/)**. My primary research focus lies at the intersection of physics-based simulation and machine learning, with a special emphasis on the simulation of human soft tissues. My recent work includes:
- a comprehensive neural network model for efficient musculoskeletal-driven skin deformation of animated characters
- a dynamic mode capture paradigm for augmenting secondary effects (e.g. inertia) on top of our network
- a robust meshing algorithm for generating volumetric hexahedron meshes from self-intersecting surfaces
- position-based nonlinear Gauss-Seidel approach for quasistatic simulation as training data
- fast ML levelset for cloth simulations. 

\[Updated 4/30/2024\] Two of my papers are just accepted to SIGGRAPH 2024. I'll give an in-person presentation on my work in Denver, CO on July 31st.

\[Updated 5/31/2024\] I successfully defended my thesis.
