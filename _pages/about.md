I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Applied Math at UCLA. My advisor is Prof.**[Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/)**. I'm working on physics-based simulation and machine learning, specifically human soft tissue simulation. My work includes numerically solving nonlinear partial differential equations, computing biomechanically correct muscle inverse dynamics and training neural networks for real-time correctives on character rigs.

I'm also a research intern at Epic Games working on the development of Chaos Flesh in Unreal Engine.
